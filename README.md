# A. Introduction
I am a student of the Data Science Professional Training program at Practicum Indonesia. During this program, I successfully completed several projects as part of the Practicum Indonesia Data Science Professional Training program.

Following are the highlights of the projects:

* **Libraries used:** pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, numpy, scipy, re, math, warnings, sklearn, scikitplot, datetime, collections, xgb, lightgbm, catboost, tqdm.auto, spacy, torch, transformers, nltk.

* **Machine Learning Models Evaluated:**

  * **Classification Models:** DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, XGBClassifier, CatBoostClassifier, LGBMClassifier .
  * **Regression Models:** LinearRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, Ridge, XGBRegressor, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor.

# B. Details on My Data Science projects
## [1. Yandex Music Analysis](https://github.com/muhyusranam86/DataScience_Portfolio/tree/main/YandexMusicProject)
Whenever we do research, we need to formulate a hypothesis that we can then test. Sometimes we accept this hypothesis; but sometimes we also reject it. To make the right decisions, a business must be able to understand whether the assumptions it makes are correct or not.

**Highlights:**
 * Data Cleaning, Principal Component Analysis, Cross Validation using GridSearchCV, Gradient Boosting Models.
 * My model is being used at Scentbird in production. Scentbird Head of Analytics appreciated my project.

## [2. Bank Loan Customers Report]()
Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

**Highlights:**
 * Defaults were found to be the highest in low income, unmarried people.
 * No relationship was found between family with kids and loan defaults.

## [3. Car Sales Market Value Prediction]()
You're an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day. You need to study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

**Highlights:**
 * Used ordinal encoding on features.
 * Evaluated regression models, gradient boosting models and tuned them with hyperparameters.
 * Metrics: Lowest RMSE of 1628.xx using XGBoost with GridSearchCV

## [4. Telecom Company Plans]()
You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

**Highlights:**
 * Investigated the quality of different classification models by changing hyperparameters.
**Metrics:**
 * Achieved Accuracy score of 78% using RandomForestRegression.

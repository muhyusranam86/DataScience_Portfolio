# Goal:
This project prepares a report for a bank’s loan division. Find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. The report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan. Identify the following from the dataset:

* Is there a connection between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
* Is there a connection between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
* Is there a connection between income level and repaying a loan on time?
* How do different loan purposes affect on-time loan repayment?

# Data
The data may contain artifacts, or values that don't correspond to reality (for instance, a negative number of days employed). This kind of thing happens when you're working with real data. You need to describe the possible reasons such data may have turned up and process it.

# Description of the data
* `children`: the number of children in the family
* `days_employed`: how long the customer has been working
* `dob_years`: the customer’s age
* `education`: the customer’s education level
* `education_id`: identifier for the customer’s education
* `family_status`: the customer’s marital status
* `family_status_id`: identifier for the customer’s marital status
* `gender`: the customer’s gender
* `income_type`: the customer’s income type
* `debt`: whether the customer has ever defaulted on a loan
* `total_income`: monthly income
* `purpose`: reason for taking out a loan
